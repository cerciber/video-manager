# adapters

This layer connect the logic of business of the application with the web and the external components.

- controllers: Receive external requests, validate input, and coordinate the execution of use cases.
- gateways: Act as adapters for external data sources, providing an abstraction layer for data access.
- presenters: Transform internal data or use case results into a presentation format for user interface or delivery through an API.
- schemas: Structured representations defining the format and composition of data, used for validation, documentation, and formatting.
